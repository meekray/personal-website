                <div class = "blog-text">
                    <p>Recently, a friend of mine reached out for a fresh set of eyes to review his college essay. There weren’t too many Robbinsvillians out here at Michigan, so I promptly accepted his request and began reviewing. After all, Michigan can never have too many New Jerseyans.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>Normally, I’d jump right into the meat of the essay to start finding flaws in structure, narration, flow, etc. This was not one of those times; I was taken aback after reading an empowering yet haunting quote in the prompt:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="padText">“We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there "is" such a thing as being too late. This is no time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.”</p>
                    <p>This line that resonates within so many was said by Martin Luther King Jr. when he spoke at the March on Washington. Dr. King reminded the nation that now was the time to unite and march forward together against racism. Though he spoke those words 51 years ago to influence a mass of people, I felt moved by the quote on a personal, individual level.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>Finally take care of matters that you’ve been lazily pushing off.</i> That’s the message that stuck with me. As I wonder about the things I’ve been meaning to do, I realize I had not done many of them. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over winter break, I set two goals: (1) Reconnect with all my of best friends from high school, and (2) rebuild by relationship with my little brother. I believe that relationships define the core of everything we do, and are somethings I need to be more cognizant of. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Every time I had thought about reaching out to my best friend who I’ve not really spoken to since mid-summer, I’ve been met with too much hesitation. I let thoughts like <i>If he’s not reaching out first, are we really friends? I have new friends now, it’s cool if I don’t reach out…</i>block me from asking for a hangout. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The same movie played with my brother, who spends more time than is healthy in front of a computer screen. Nowadays, our interactions don’t go beyond a few words over morning breakfast. Every time I’d walk by his room, I’d let things like our <i>incompatible personality types and its not worth it</i> cloud by judgement. Like a movie that I’ve seen before, and too many times. Winter break had passed. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are 7 breaks before I’m tossed into the real world. Sitting in a coffeeshop in Ann Arbor as I right this, I realize I’ve become disconnected further with the people who I wanted to reconnect with. Now, having realized this, I am making it my personal goal to become closer to my brother and my high school friends than ever before, by fighting the little things that held me back before. In the end, the worst resignation is the one that slowly builds.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>That being said, what are some things that you’ve been meaning to do? Is the issue time, uncertainty, or lack of confidence? Whatever it is, take the steps now to resolve those resignations. I promise, the feeling of not achieving those things aches much harder than what’s holding you back right now. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="padText">I'm glad my friend asked me to review his essay. Above all, thank you Dr. King for inspiring me with your words. I hope I inspired someone, somewhere the same way with this article!</p>
